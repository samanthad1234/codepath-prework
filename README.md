## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. Twitter: I like that Twitter is a text based app that allows users to share information and images while also having a user friendly interface.
2. Tiktok: I like that Tiktok allows users to upload all different kinds of videos and I especially like the different kinds of filters they have on there those are pretty fun.
3. Pinterest: I like that Pinterest is mainly just a photo app and that it isnt as "social" as other social media platforms. Sometimes I just like looking at pictures. I like that you are able to save your favorite looks and pictures in your own personal albums.

I would like to build an app that allows people to upload pictures and links to items they want and have them all organized by category, price, etc... all in one place. Like a wishlist but for more than one item.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
